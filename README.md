# pangenomes-metagenomes
A workflow for complete analysis of bacterial metagenomes and pagenome graphs and direct viewing in panchae. It will also analyze metagenomes from both illumina and long reads.
It will analyze the bacterial genomes and the genoems from the assembly to the annotation using the Prokka and then will create the pangenome and the pangraphs. 
It will also provide the support for the variant estimation.
